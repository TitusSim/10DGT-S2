# Diffrent types of variables
# Store a number
print('Check out this number!')
num_69 = 420
print(num_69)

# Store a string
name = "Titus Sim"
print(name)
name = "Skibidi Toilet"
print(name)
print('Trystan is super duper duper weak \nSIKE THATS THE WRONG NUMBER')
print()

# Do calculations in a variable and store the result
sum=69+69 # NOT GOOD DONT DO THIS
sum = " 
69 + 69 = 138" # very good, this follows PEP8 Python conventions
print(sum)

# Adding strings together is called a concatentation
Concatentation = name + sum 
print(Concatentation)
